Radiation Damage Recovery Project UMD

The project contains scripts/data/results only for measurements with the alpha source for now. 
Most of the code has been written by Geng-Yuan Jeng.

```bash
.
└── alphaSource                 # Main directory
    ├── data                    # Here  you put your .root files
    ├── results                 # Plots and results go here
    │   └── 20181027
    └── scripts                 # All the scripts and the routines that we are going to use
        └── Plotter             # Routines for plotting, fitting and style configuration
```

In order to able to run this code you should have already installed Python and ROOT.
